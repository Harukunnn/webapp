# Agentic Travel Orchestrator

This web app recreates the “Ultra-Optimized Mega Agentic Prompt” from scratch as an interactive interface. It simulates a single agent that orchestrates the six travel roles (profile, flights, hotels, activities, itinerary, budget) with safety controls and step-by-step validation.

## How it works
- Fill in the discovery form (departure, destination, budget, vibe, length of stay, flexibility).
- The safety filter blocks any banned destination and suggests safe alternatives.
- Each virtual agent proposes 2–3 A/B/C options to pick before moving to the next stage.
- Once the package is chosen, a structured summary is generated with an option to export the text.

No data is sent anywhere: everything is simulated in the browser to give the illusion of a multi-agent AI that strictly follows the original prompt’s rules.
